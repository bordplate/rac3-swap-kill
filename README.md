# Weapon Swap on Kill mod
For PS3 Ratchet & Clank 3 (NPEA00387). 

## Important note
There is a consistent crash that occurs in some cases when trying to switch weapon using triangle quick select. Just don't do that and you'll probably be fine. 

## Emulator compatibility
I haven't tested this on emulator, but it might work. If it doesn't work, then it doesn't, you probably can't fix that and I certainly won't.

## How to use? 
* You need the PAL version of Ratchet & Clank (NPEA00387). 
* For console users, you first need a Homebrew ENabled (HEN) console, or custom firmware. Google how to do it, you'll figure it out. 
* [RaCMAN](https://github.com/MichaelRelaxen/racman) running on your PC.
* Download this repo by clicking the green "<> Code" button at the top of this page, then "Download ZIP"
* In RaCMAN:
  * Connect to your console or RPCS3 emulator
  * Menu -> Patches and mods...
  * Click "Install mod" and find the downloaded .zip
